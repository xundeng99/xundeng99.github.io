My name is Xun Deng, and I am a second year MASc student at University of Toronto. I am very lucky to be co-supervised by [Andreas Veneris](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~veneris/AndreasVeneris.htm) and [Fan Long](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fanl/). 

### Research Interests
My current research focuses on smart contract security and oracles. In general, I am interested in software verifcation, system softwares, and computer security. I am also interested in image processing and AI art generation. 

### Education
I graduated with high honors from Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Toronto (UofT) in June, 2022.
